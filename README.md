Efficient implementation of scientific computing or numerical analysis problems.

Part of the course work 'C++ for Scientific Computing' offered at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden.

# How the software is organized
This was developed using C++.

- `01`: To implement Taylor's series of sine and cosine functions using Horner's scheme. Also, to implement Adaptive Simpson Integration (ASI) method.

- `02`: To implement exponential of a matrix.

- `03`: To implement 4-sided domains and structured grids.

- `04`: To implement partial differential equations on structured grids.

# Keywords
